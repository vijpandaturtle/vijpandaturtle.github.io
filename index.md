excerpt: "About Me Vijayasri Iyer"

## Hi there ! 
I'm vij. I'm an Engineer by profession. I'd like to call myself someone who loves to learn, dream about and create new things that make a difference in someone's life (including my own!). I'm currently working on projects involving Machine Learning in the Classical and Quantum Computing Domain. Recently I started learning about systems thinking because I believe different types of tech are really pieces of a large puzzle. In order to really solve a problem, you need to figure out how to put them together. 

**Research Interests** - Computer Vision, Machine Learning (in Healthcare, Robotics, Neurotechnology & Creativity)

## Experience
- Pursuing a Master's degree at Amrita University, having worked there as an intern at drug-discovery lab and for 6 months as a software engineer/Junior research fellow. 
- Published two research papers at IEEE, Taylor&Francis and presented posters and talks at IEEE-IV BROAD Workshop 2020 and WiML@ICML 2020. 
- Finished rigorous online coursework with projects in Deep Learning, Robotics Software Engineering, Internet of Things and Cloud Computing. 
- Collaborated with several research groups across the world on technical projects.
